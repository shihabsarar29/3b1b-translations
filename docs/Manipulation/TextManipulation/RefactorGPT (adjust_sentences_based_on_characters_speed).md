# adjust_sentences_based_on_characters_speed Function Documentation

## Overview
This function adjusts the sentences based on the disparity between how long we predict the final audio will be and how long it actually is. It uses 
GPT-3.5 to adjust the sentences based to either be longer or shorter while still retaining the original meaning.

- `file_path`: **str**
    - The file path to the transcript data in JSON format.
- `language_averages_path`: **str**
    - The path to the JSON file containing the average characters spoken per second for each language.
- `save`: **bool** (default: **False**)
    - If True, saves the adjusted transcript to a file. If False, returns the adjusted transcript as a dictionary.
- `save_path`: **str** (default: **None**)
    - The path to save the adjusted transcript to. Only necessary if `save` is True.

## Returns
- ```dict```: The adjusted transcript as a dictionary. Only returned if `save` is False.
- ```None```: If `save` is True, the function returns None.
